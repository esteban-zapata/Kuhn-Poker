Kuhn Poker:
Rules:

2 players
3 card deck {A, K, Q}
Each starts the hand with $2
Each antes (i.e., makes forced bet of) $1 at the start of the hand
Each player is dealt 1 card
Each has $1 remaining for betting
There is 1 betting round and 1 bet size of $1
The highest card is the best (i.e., A > K > Q)

~Action starts with P1, who can Bet $1 or Check

If P1 bets, P2 can either Call or Fold
If P1 checks, P2 can either Bet or Check
If P2 bets after P1 checks, P1 can then Call or Fold
These outcomes are possible:

If a player folds to a bet, the other player wins the pot of $2 (profit of $1)
If both players check, the highest card player wins the pot of $2 (profit of $1)
If there is a bet and call, the highest card player wins the pot of $4 (profit of $2)


The Bluffer!!!:
Bluff if get them to fold > (1/3) of the time
 L    L   W
-1 + -1 + 2 = 0, break even when bluff 1/3


Bluff Catcher!!!:
pot: 2
bet: 1 <- so theres 3 in pot now

-1 + -1 + -1 + 3 = 0, break  even when 
they're bluffing 1/4 of time
